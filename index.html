 <p>Welcome  to the student association website. We offer Societies, Student Associations and Class reps for the students to join. This is an opportunity for the student to gain something from the extracurricular activity. This will help the students to become a better person when it comes to education. The benefit of joining this is that you will learn something new from it, meet new people, improve communication skills, build leadership and attend workshops. If you have any questions, just let us know through email, or you can visit the staff from the student association area. </p>

  <p>The purpose of creating a website for student association is to offer student opportunites to help them build confidence and making sure we offfer more activities for the students to participate so students can enjoy new opportuniteis</p>
